# Portfolio_Website
The objective of this project was to create a personal website that serves as a digital portfolio, showcasing my
skills, experiences, and interests. The website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and built entirely with HTML
and CSS. It is a responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user
experience
